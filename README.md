# Identification-of-Indian-Currency-for-Visually-Impaired-Individuals

1.	Project Overview:
o	The goal is to build an application that can recognize and announce the denomination of Indian currency notes when the user points their camera at them.
o	We’ll use deep learning techniques to train a model that can identify different currency notes.
2.	Data Collection:
o	a dataset of Indian currency images.images of various denominations (₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, and ₹2000).
o	dataset includes diverse lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds.
3.	Preprocessing:
o	Resized the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
o	Normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
4.	Model Selection:
o	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work well for image classification tasks.
o	Popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch is used to build and train the model.
5.	Model Architecture:
o	fully connected layers on top for classification.
o	The output layer should have as many neurons as there are currency denominations.
6.	Training the Model:
o	Spliting the dataset into training and validation sets.
o	Train the model using transfer learning .
o	Monitor accuracy and loss during training.
7.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the model’s performance on the validation set.
o	Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8.	Deployment:
o	Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on mobile devices.
o	Create a simple mobile app (Android or iOS) that captures images from the camera.
o	Use the model to predict the denomination and provide audio feedback.
